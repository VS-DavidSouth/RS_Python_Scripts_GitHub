## Remote Sensing HPAI scripts

Note that this repo is no longer just for Python scripts. Its also got some R.

These scripts were developed by David South and others as part of a USDA-APHIS and CSU cooperative agreement.

Most of these scripts are for development of a project we are calling the Hybrid Model, which
combines aspects of the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator with remote sensing 
methods to identify poultry barns from areal imagery.
