## Remote Sensing HPAI scripts

Note that this repo is no longer just for Python scripts. Its also got some R.

These scripts were developed by David South and others as part of a USDA-APHIS and CSU cooperative agreement.

These scripts are for the Hybrid Model project, which
combines aspects of the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator with remote sensing 
methods to identify poultry barns from aerial imagery on a natioanl scale. 

### Validation counties
Original 35 counties refers to the regional model, which the hybrid model was based on. It used analyst skill on outputs from Feature Analyst to locate poultry farms from aerial imagery with very high accuracy.
