This document explains the naming convention of all geospatial files and 
files related to the remote sensing or Automated_Review procedure.
Check with the NAMING CONVENTIONS section of the Automated_Review.py script
to make sure that this document matches any changes made in there.

NAMING CONVENTIONS:
Names for all files created in this script will follow the the same format.
     [prefix]_[ST]_Z[##]_c[#]_[CountyName]_i[#].[ext]

Not all files will have the all of the identifiers listed below.
When in doubt, look for similar files for reference, or 
include as many identifiers as are applicable.

Identifiers:
    [prefix]     -> a unique identifier for each type of file, 
                    below is a dictionary explaining each prefix
    [ST]         -> the 2-letter state abbreviation
    Z[##]        -> the UTM zone number
    c[#]         -> the cluster number
    [CountyName] -> the specific county name
    i[#]         -> the iteration number
    .[ext]       -> the file extension (this is not shown when 
                    viewing ArcGIS files in ArcCatalog)

Unique prefixes:
    NAIP: Downloaded 1m resolution NAIP areal imagery
    NAIP2m: 2m resampled NAIP imagery
    Model: AFE file that is used to create the Batch files 
           for a particular state
    ModelGDB: The file geodatabase that was used to create
              the Model for that state
    ModelMXD: The ArcMap MXD that was used to run Feature 
              Analyst to create the Model
    BatchGDB: A file geodatabase that contains all the 
              intermediate files for the creation of the 
              Batch file
    BatchMXD: The ArcMap MXD file that was used to run Feature
              Analyst to create the Batch file
    Clip: The Batch file clipped to the county
    Mask: The Clip file with points removed based on a series
          of masking layers
    LAR: The Mask file with points removed based on Length or
         AspRatio values outside of the thresholds
    ProbSurf: The LAR file with points removed according to a
              threshold value for the probablity surface
    Integrate: The ProbSurf file with points within 100m of
               each other are moved on top of one another at the
               centroid; no points are removed
    CollectEvents: Integrate file with points on top of one
                   another combined to a single point
    SimSampling: The CollectEvents file with points sorted into
                 bins and many points removed to ensure each bin
                 has the appropriate number of points, according
                 to the Adjusted NASS values
    AutoReview: The final stage, which is the CollectEvents file but projected into NAD 1983 with coordinate fields added
